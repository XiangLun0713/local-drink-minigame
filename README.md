Local Drinkie is a minigame website that introduces local drinks from Malaysia. The game is set in a coffee shop themed map, where the player controls a character to interact with NPCs and learn about local drinks. The game is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

In the game, the player will be able to move around the map and engage in conversation with NPCs to learn about various local drinks. The conversation with the NPCs will provide information about the ingredients, history, and unique characteristics of each local drink.

We hope you enjoy playing Local Drinkie and learning about the rich culture of local drinks in Malaysia. Thank you for visiting our repository!
